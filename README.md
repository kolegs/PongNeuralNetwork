# PongNeuralNetwork

This project is an example of backpropagation in neural networks.

In this particural project network learns how to play pong game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)

It is using supervised learning. I know that using other technics are better for this particular problem but the project was created to undestand how backpropagation works.

Hope you enjoy!
